    <h1><u>Big Cat</u></h1>
    <p>The term <b>big cat</b>" is typically used to refer to any of the five living members of the genus <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panthera">Panthera</a></i>,
        namely tiger, lion, jaguar, leopard, and snow leopard.[1] Except the snow leopard, these species are able to roar. A more liberal and expansicve definition of the term 
        includes species outside of the <i>panthera</i> including the cougar, clouded leopard, Sunda clouded leopard, cheetah, and sometimes the several lynx species, although these
        added species also do not roar.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Despite enormous differences in size, various car species are quite similar in both structure and behavious, with the exception of the cheetah, which significantly stands
        out from the other big and small cats. All cats are carnivores and some are efficient apex predators.[3] Their native ranges include the Americas, Africa, and Asia.
